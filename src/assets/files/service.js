    desc: "Personal loans can be used for a variety of expenses, and they can go by various names (see types of personal loans, below).Though many of them work similarly, lenders may give them specific, purpose-driven titles and offer varying terms depending on each purpose. For example, LightStream currently offers one type of loan specifically to pay for a wedding, and another purpose-made for financing home improvements — with each loan type having its own interest rate range.",

    desc: "A mortgage, also known as a home loan, allows you to borrow to finance what is likely to be the biggest purchase of your lifetime. There are various types of mortgages for different borrowers, including first-time home buyers and military veterans. Like with auto loans, failing to repay your mortgage could result in a foreclosure and eviction.",

    desc: "Most new and outstanding student loans in the U.S. are federal loans, meaning they are held and managed by the Department of Education. Millions of families have also relied on private or alternative student loans to bridge any remaining gap in their school’s cost of attendance. Student loan repayment is notoriously fraught with pitfalls, making it treacherous for borrowers who aren’t familiar with their options.",

    desc: "Borrowing money to pay for an asset that quickly and continuously depreciates in value isn’t ideal. But if you need wheels, an auto loan could be your best remaining option. You could shop around with financial institutions as well as car companies and dealerships. Just keep in mind that your car could be seized if you fail to repay your loan. Always make equal comparisons by looking at APRs, loan terms and other details of each lender’s quote. If you have excellent credit, you might even qualify for an introductory rate of 0.00%.",

    desc: "A payday loan is designed to advance your wages. You might be tempted to borrow a payday loan to cover an unforeseen expense before your paycheck hits your checking account. Payday loans are typically considered predatory debt, however, because of the short repayment periods and often triple-digit APRs, not to mention fees. You might borrow $500 but end up repaying thousands of dollars.",

    desc: "Perhaps the most traditional form of a secured loan, a pawn shop loan involves yielding a piece of property (such as jewelry or high-priced electronics) for short-term cash. When the borrower repays their debt on or ahead of schedule, the shop owner returns the property. If the borrower doesn’t repay the debt, the shop owner may sell the item after a certain period has elapsed, making this a risky proposition. Your credit is not factored into the loan, and repayment terms and interest rates vary by pawn shop.",

Like with many of the other types of loans on this list, small businesses loans are available from banks, credit unions and online lenders. And you could qualify whether your business is a sole proprietorship or limited liability company (LLC) in your garage or a smaller corporation.",

    desc: "A credit builder loan is intended to help you do just that — build your credit. Whether you’re trying to establish a credit history or repair one that has been less-than-stellar, a credit builder loan gives you the opportunity to show lenders that you are a responsible borrower by making timely payments on the loan. Once approved, the amount of the loan is placed in a savings account, which is held by the bank and is not at your disposal. You make monthly payments on that amount, and once you’ve paid it all back, then you receive the funds along with interest or dividends in some cases.",

    desc: "Depending on your credit and the type of debt you’re carrying, debt consolidation loans can help you repay your debt at a lower rate. When comparing your loan options, pay attention to loan APRs, or annual percentage rates. This rate represents the interest rate plus fees, and is a more accurate representation of your cost of borrowing.",

    desc: "According to a 2019 LendingTree survey, 61% of Americans reported they were dreading the December holidays because of the associated costs. For gifts alone, a typical consumer expected to spend $602.65, and that number jumped to $850.38 if they had children under 18. On top of that, there’s often the cost of travel, parties, decorations and more that people rack up in the name of happy holidays. To help ease some of that stress and cover holidays costs, some consumers turn to holiday loans.",

    desc: "A word of caution about medical loans, however: In many cases, medical providers will provide payment plans with more attractive terms than medical loans, such as no-interest plans. They also may be willing to negotiate when it comes to price. In any case, it’s a good idea to do some investigating before you take out a medical loan to make sure it’s the best option possible (plus, you should also note that you may also have to pay an origination fee for a medical loan).",
